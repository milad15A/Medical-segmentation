</div>

This repository has been created to delve into the realm of AI within the field of medicine. Our goal is to devise and execute a straightforward but precise initiative in this domain. I express my gratitude to Howsam Academy and Dr. Seyed Sajad Ashrafi for their assistance during challenging situations.

## 1. Problem Statement

This segment focuses on a prevalent form of cancer in the population and an effective deep-learning approach to aid in its treatment. However, before delving into that, we aim to provide a concise definition of semantic segmentation and its related concepts.
  ##1-Image segmentation: Image segmentation involves dividing an image into meaningful segments or regions based on certain characteristics, such as color, intensity, texture, or boundaries.
  ##2- Semantic segmentation: the algorithm attempts to label every single pixel.
  in medicine, segmenting can out the image exactly which pixels correspond to certain parts of the patient's anatomy
